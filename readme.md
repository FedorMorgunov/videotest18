Project Task to Build a Dashboard for Videos
This task consists of the following steps in the order of complexity (bonus points for getting to the end):

Build a simple video player Web or GUI app using Javascript or Python and upload the code to a github repository: https://github.com/aikynetix/videotest18

1. Video display should happen as slow-motion playback speed so that human actions are easy to understand from the video.
2. Enable saving of frames (images) when video is paused by the user.
3. Video display should be compressed with codecs available for web with 50% less size in video file sizes in storage or memory.
If you use ChatGPT, open-source code or stackoverflow code snippets, it should be documented in the code.
The code should be built from VSCode with documented requirements such as all required packages, all dependency libraries. Enjoy this task!
